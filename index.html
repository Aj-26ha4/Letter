    <h2>Dear Suz,</h2><p>From the very first moment I saw you—sitting on another chair to my left—something gentle stirred within me. I didn’t know your name, your voice, or your story, and I never imagined we would turn out to be classmates. You were simply a quiet spark in a moment I didn’t expect to remember, yet somehow I did.</p>

<p>Fate moved in a way I still can’t fully explain. During the EDA grouping, you were absent, so I had no reason to expect that your name would ever cross my path. Many classmates asked to join my group, and I accepted them, wanting to help. I thought everything was already final when I submitted the list. But fate has a playful way of nudging us. Someone approached me and asked if I could add one more name—your name.</p>

<p>I honestly wanted to decline because we already had so many members. But at that exact moment, something inside me whispered, <em>Don’t refuse. Add that one.</em> I didn’t know why. I didn’t even know you. But that feeling was strong and clear, as if destiny itself insisted.</p>

<p>When I created the group chat and searched the name that was added, your face appeared. And in that instant, everything made sense. The quiet certainty I felt was right all along. You were the person destiny had tried to place in my path twice—first through a memory, then through a name.</p>

<p>When we finally met, the connection deepened. You spoke with warmth and life, and I found myself listening more than talking. I avoided your eyes because the moment I looked at you, I knew I would smile—and I didn’t want you to notice how much your presence affected me. Then you mentioned you had a boyfriend, and though my heart quietly ached, I understood. Someone as gentle and radiant as you would naturally be cherished by someone.</p>

<p>Still, you became a soft inspiration—an unspoken reason to keep going, to show up, to try. My feelings came without warning, and though I know they are not mine to hold on to, the heart loves where it feels safe, not where it is allowed.</p>

<p>I am learning to let go slowly and gracefully. Time will do its quiet work. But for now, allow me this honesty: I care for you deeply, far more than I ever intended.</p>

<p>Thank you, Suz, for brightening my days without ever trying. And if you ever need help with your studies, know that I am always here.</p>

<div class="signature">With sincerity,<br/>AJ</div>
