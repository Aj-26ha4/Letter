    <h2>Dear Suz,</h2><p>From the very first moment I saw you—sitting on another chair to my left—something gentle stirred within me. I didn’t know your name, your voice, or your story, and I never imagined we would turn out to be classmates. You were simply a quiet spark in a moment I didn’t expect to remember, yet somehow I did.</p>

<p>Fate moved in a way I still can’t fully explain. During the EDA grouping, you were absent, so I had no reason to expect that your name would ever cross my path. Many classmates asked to join my group, and I accepted them, wanting to help. I thought everything was already final when I submitted the list. But fate has a playful way of nudging us. Someone approached me and asked if I could add one more name—your name.</p>

<p>I honestly wanted to decline because we already had so many members. But at that exact moment, something inside me whispered, <em>Don’t refuse. Add that one.</em> I didn’t know why. I didn’t even know you. But that feeling was strong and clear, as if destiny itself insisted.</p>

<p>When I created the group chat and searched the name that was added, your face appeared. And in that instant, everything made sense. The quiet certainty I felt was right all along. You were the person destiny had tried to place in my path twice—first through a memory, then through a name.</p>

<p>When we finally met, the connection deepened. You spoke with warmth and life, and I found myself listening more than talking. I avoided your eyes because the moment I looked at you, I knew I would smile—and I didn’t want you to notice how much your presence affected me. Then you mentioned you had a boyfriend, and though my heart quietly ached, I understood. Someone as gentle and radiant as you would naturally be cherished by someone.</p>

<p>Still, you became a soft inspiration—an unspoken reason to keep going, to show up, to try. My feelings came without warning, and though I know they are not mine to hold on to, the heart loves where it feels safe, not where it is allowed.</p>

<p>I am learning to let go slowly and gracefully. Time will do its quiet work. But for now, allow me this honesty: I care for you deeply, far more than I ever intended.</p>

<p>Thank you, Suz, for brightening my days without ever trying. And if you ever need help with your studies, know that I am always here.</p>

<div class="signature">With sincerity,<br/>AJ</div>

</html>  <h1>Fundamental Principles in Civil Engineering</h1>
  <p>In civil engineering, we have to understand some basic ideas that guide all the work we do. These are called fundamental principles. They help us plan, design, and build things like buildings, roads, and bridges safely and correctly.</p>  <h2>2.1 Applied Mathematics</h2>
  <p>Applied math means using math to solve real problems. In civil engineering, we use math every day to measure, calculate, and design structures. Here's what it includes:</p>  <h3>Algebra</h3>
  <p>We use algebra to solve unknowns in equations. For example, calculating load or force.</p>
  <div class="formula">F = ma</div>
  <p><strong>F</strong> is force, <strong>m</strong> is mass, <strong>a</strong> is acceleration.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example:</strong> If mass = 10 kg and acceleration = 5 m/s²,<br>
    F = 10 × 5 = <strong>50 N</strong>
  </div>  <h3>Geometry</h3>
  <p>Used to calculate areas and volumes. Helpful when working on construction sites or drawing plans.</p>
  <div class="formula">Area of triangle = 1/2 × base × height</div>
  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example:</strong> Base = 6 m, Height = 4 m<br>
    Area = 1/2 × 6 × 4 = <strong>12 m²</strong>
  </div>  <h3>Trigonometry</h3>
  <p>Helps in measuring angles and slopes, especially for roads or roofs.</p>
  <div class="formula">sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse</div>
  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example:</strong> If opposite = 3 m and hypotenuse = 5 m<br>
    sin(θ) = 3 / 5 = <strong>0.6</strong>
  </div>  <h3>Statistics</h3>
  <p>Used to understand data like rainfall, traffic, or material strength.</p>
  <div class="formula">Mean = (sum of all values) / (number of values)</div>
  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example:</strong> Values = 3, 5, 7<br>
    Mean = (3+5+7)/3 = <strong>5</strong>
  </div>  <h2>2.2 Hydraulics and Fluid Mechanics</h2>
  <p>This part of civil engineering studies how water and other fluids move and behave. It's very important for things like designing water systems, drainage, and flood control.</p>  <h3>Hydrostatic Pressure</h3>
  <div class="formula">P = ρgh</div>
  <p><strong>P</strong> is pressure, <strong>ρ</strong> is water density (usually 1000 kg/m³), <strong>g</strong> is gravity (9.8 m/s²), <strong>h</strong> is depth.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example:</strong> At 5 meters deep:<br>
    P = 1000 × 9.8 × 5 = <strong>49,000 Pa</strong> or 49 kPa
  </div>  <h3>Bernoulli's Equation</h3>
  <div class="formula">P + 1/2ρv² + ρgh = constant</div>
  <p>It explains how pressure, speed, and height affect fluid energy.</p>  <h3>Continuity Equation</h3>
  <div class="formula">A₁V₁ = A₂V₂</div>
  <p>This means what flows in must flow out, if no leaks.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example:</strong> If pipe 1 has area 2 m² and speed 3 m/s, and pipe 2 has area 1 m²:<br>
    A₂V₂ = A₁V₁ → 1 × V₂ = 2 × 3 → V₂ = <strong>6 m/s</strong>
  </div>  <h3>Manning’s Equation (for open channels like canals)</h3>
  <div class="formula">V = (1/n) R<sup>2/3</sup> S<sup>1/2</sup></div>
  <p><strong>V</strong> is flow speed, <strong>n</strong> is Manning’s number (depends on surface), <strong>R</strong> is hydraulic radius, <strong>S</strong> is slope.</p>  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Applied Math and Fluid Mechanics are very important in Civil Engineering. They help us solve problems and build things properly. Even if the math seems hard at first, it helps make sure our work is safe, strong, and useful for people.</p></body>
